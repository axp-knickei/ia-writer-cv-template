## Template Guide (Delete this section when exporting)

This document uses your custom **GitHub CV** template with **Lora** (Headers) and **Jost** (Body). Here is how to format your text to make it look right:

### 1. The Header
Write your **Name** as a Level 1 Heading (`# Name`).
Write your **Contact Info** immediately below it as a normal paragraph. The template will automatically center both and draw a line underneath.

### 2. Sections
Use Level 2 Headings (`## Experience`) for main sections. The template applies the elegant **Lora** font and a thick divider line.

### 3. Jobs
Use Level 3 Headings (`### Job Title`) for your role. The template forces this into **UPPERCASE SANS-SERIF** (Jost Bold) to contrast with the elegant section headers.

### 4. Metadata
Use Level 4 Headings (`#### Date | Location`) for company names, dates, or locations. The template styles this as small, grey text to keep it subtle.

### 5. PDF Export
When you export to PDF:
1. Go to **File > Print...**
2. Choose **Save as PDF** (or Microsoft Print to PDF).
3. Ensure **Paper Size** is set to **A4**.
4. Ensure **Margins** are set to **Default** (the template handles the margins internally).
